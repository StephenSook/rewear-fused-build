# REWEAR-FUSED

**Safe to wear, able to be remade.**

REWEAR-FUSED closes the textile-to-textile recycling loop on children's stretch apparel. It co-designs two matched molecules at once: a new, enzymatically-cleavable elastane fiber, and the de novo enzyme designed from scratch to cleave it. Around that loop sits a deployable Digital Recyclability Passport that proves each garment is safe and routes it to the right end-of-life.

Built for the Cox Enterprises **"Play With Purpose"** Sustainability Hackathon, Carter's **Making & Remaking** track.

> Everything REWEAR-FUSED produces is an **in-silico design with benchmark-referenced metrics**, not a wet-lab-validated material or enzyme. Every number traces to a real pipeline output or a verified citation. No synthetic data, no fictional persona. The honesty is on a [`/judges`](frontend/src/app/judges/page.tsx) page that tiers exactly what is real.

## The problem

Carter's already collects worn baby clothes through KIDCYCLE, then shreds them into insulation and pet bedding, because two walls stop a onesie from ever becoming a onesie again.

- **Wall 1, chemical safety.** Nobody can prove the recovered fabric is chemically safe for infant skin.
- **Wall 2, elastane.** Nobody can break down the elastane woven into every stretch garment.

Elastane is in about **80%** of all clothing, and as little as **1%** of it makes a textile recycler reject the whole garment. Only about **1%** of garments are recycled fiber-to-fiber today. REWEAR-FUSED knocks down both walls.

## REWEAR-FUSED in one loop

> A worn onesie enters. The passport proves it is safe and routes it. We design a new cleavable elastane, design a matched enzyme against its exact bond, the enzyme cleaves it to recoverable monomers, and it re-spins into a new onesie. Neither the molecule nor the enzyme existed 72 hours ago.

</p>

## What it does

- **Engine A, Cleavable Elastane Design.** Constraint-guided virtual screening of polyurethane-urea chemical space. Aliphatic isocyanates only (so nothing carcinogenic comes off near a baby), the cleavable bond in the amorphous soft segment (so the stretch survives), 25 to 35 percent hard segment. It emits the carbamate microenvironment as the enzyme's substrate target.
- **Engine B, De Novo Carbamate Hydrolase.** An enzyme designed from scratch (RFdiffusion to LigandMPNN to Boltz-2 to PLACER to FoldSeek) to cleave the exact bond in Engine A's fiber, with an engineered near-neutral Ser-His-Asp triad so it does not damage companion cotton. Anchored on, not copied from, the published UMG-SP2 urethanase transition-state geometry.
- **Engine C, Digital Recyclability Passport.** A live compliance classifier that routes each garment **clear / lab-test / divert** against real US and EU regulation (CPSIA, California PFAS law, REACH, OEKO-TEX, EU ESPR) and emits a scannable GS1 Digital Link / EU Digital Product Passport. The part Carter's could deploy in Year 1.

## Architecture

REWEAR-FUSED is one inverse-design loop, two coupled molecules. Rather than attack today's crystalline elastane (which defeats every enzyme), it redesigns the fiber to be cleavable and designs the enzyme to match.

```

The product is wired so the live demo never depends on a real-time GPU job. The pipelines pre-compute signed artifacts; the deployed app renders them through real code; Engine C also runs live.

## What is real, what is in-silico

We would rather you check than take our word. The full tiering is the in-app [`/judges`](frontend/src/app/judges/page.tsx) page.

| Component | Tier | TRL | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engine C, the Passport | **WIRED LIVE** | 6 | a real FastAPI endpoint + the deployed UI; the Year-1 deployable product |
| The application (5 views) | **WIRED LIVE** | - | deployed on Vercel, reading the signed artifact bundle through real code |
| Training + reference data | **REAL DATA** | - | CPSC Recalls, EU Safety Gate, Toxic-Free Future / Peaslee PFAS, OEKO-TEX |
| Engine A, the fiber | **IN-SILICO** | 3 | constraint-guided screening; predicted properties with benchmark-referenced confidence |
| Engine B, the enzyme | **IN-SILICO** | 2 | de novo design; PLACER preorganization + FoldSeek novelty on the Lauko thresholds |
| Wet-lab validation | **FORWARD** | - | not done in 72 hours; the Cox Cleantech Residency ask |

## The five views

| | View | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | **Story** | the two walls and the verified stats, as a scroll-driven cold open |
| 02 | **Passport** | garment intake, the clear/lab-test/divert router with citations, the scannable QR |
| 03 | **Fiber** (Engine A) | the screening funnel, the candidate, and the mechanics-vs-cleavability trade-off curve |
| 04 | **Enzyme** (Engine B) | the Mol\* structure with the Ser-His-Asp triad, the PLACER metric, the FoldSeek badge |
| 05 | **Loop** | the GPU particle storm: onesie to cleavage to monomers to a new onesie, scrubbed by scroll |

## Responsible AI and honesty

REWEAR-FUSED is decision support and a design tool, not a validated material or a medical claim. Everything is in-silico at TRL 2-3 and labeled as such on every predicted-property panel. Engine C trains on real public data only; no synthetic data reaches the judged path. Demo garments are real Carter's product archetypes with real published compositions, and no fictional persona is used. Aliphatic-only chemistry is enforced so no aromatic carcinogen can be released. Every claim is checkable in the code and on the [`/judges`](frontend/src/app/judges/page.tsx) page.
