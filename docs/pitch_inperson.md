# REWEAR-FUSED · In-Person Science-Fair Pitch (final)

Delivered 1:1 at the table on June 17, repeated many times. Lead with the number, point at the proof on screen, answer in one sentence, then stop and hand back the wheel. The 90-second core survives 40 reps; save the 3-minute and the residency close for judges who lean in.

**Mechanics:** two operators, one drives the laptop (pre-positions the next view), one talks. Deterministic demo mode (Shift+D / ?demo=1) is the spine, so the app is always on the right view when a judge arrives. Reset to the hook view between reps. Two laptops, hotspot backup, offline localhost, the 4K recording on the desktop as the fallback.

**BANNED PHRASE:** never "72 hours" / "built this weekend." Novelty is **"no prior art / first publicly disclosed."** When you do not know, say "we would validate that in the wet lab." Never invent a number.

## (1) The 30-second hook (every judge gets this; hand them the laptop on sentence one)

> "Your kid outgrows a Carter's 12-month cotton-blend legging, 95 percent cotton, 5 percent elastane. It can't become another legging, it becomes pet bedding. Not because it is worn out, but because of that 5 percent. As little as 1 percent of elastane makes a textile recycler reject the entire garment, and elastane is in about 80 percent of all clothing.
>
> Everyone trying to fix this designs an enzyme to attack the elastane that already exists, a crystalline fiber that defeats every native enzyme on the intact fiber. We inverted it. We co-designed a new cleavable elastane AND the matched enzyme that uniquely cleaves it. Two coupled molecules, neither with any prior art. We did not make recycling a little better; we removed the chemistry that made the loop impossible."

Then stop. "Want me to show you the loop, or do you want to dig into one piece?"

## (2) The 90-second core walk (the default "show me"; walk Passport -> Fiber -> Enzyme -> Loop)

- **Beat 1, the two walls (10s):** "Carter's already collects worn baby clothes through KIDCYCLE and downcycles them into pet bedding, because two walls stop a onesie becoming a onesie again. They can't prove the fabric is chemically safe for infant skin, and they can't break down the elastane."
- **Beat 2, Engine C, the working floor (20s)** [Passport]: "This is live. A compliance classifier trained on 631 real CPSC recall records routes every garment clear, lab-test, or divert against actual US and EU regulation, then emits a scannable passport. Scan it." [hand them the QR] "That is the piece Carter's deploys in year one."
- **Beat 3, Engine A, the fiber (15s)** [trade-off curve]: "Engine A screens fiber chemistries. Aliphatic isocyanates only, so nothing carcinogenic comes off near a baby. The cleavable bond sits in the soft segment so the stretch survives. This shaded window, 25 to 35 percent, is the honest trade-off between cleavability and elasticity."
- **Beat 4, Engine B, the shouldn't-be-possible moment (25s)** [Mol* live]: "No de novo carbamate hydrolase has ever been publicly disclosed. That is exactly what we set out to design. What is rotating is the published anchor we built against, CALB, PDB 1TCA, labeled illustrative: it shows the exact Ser-His-Asp pocket the design reconstructs, engineered near-neutral pH so it spares the cotton. Our novelty target is no close PDB match, TM-score under 0.5; the designed structure and its live PLACER and FoldSeek numbers drop in at our freeze gate. Download the reference scaffold to inspect the active-site geometry."
- **Beat 5, the close (20s)** [Loop]: "Here is the loop closing. The bond cleaves, the fiber depolymerizes into recoverable monomers, re-spun into a new onesie, the two colors fuse at the cleavage. By design the same material becomes a new onesie again and again, not pet bedding once and landfill forever: a regenerative loop, not a one-time downcycle. And because the fiber is drop-in to existing spinning, one license scales it without a single new factory. Carter's already pays TerraCycle to downcycle. Engine C is a per-SKU compliance-and-passport subscription, priced as a fraction of the avoided SB 707 fee: we move that line item to a passport that lowers their EPR modulation and pre-positions the EU passport. Today's fee avoidance funds tomorrow's fiber loop. We're the Nexus Circular of textiles."

Stop. "What would you want to dig into?"

## (3) The 3-minute extended (when a judge leans in)

Hook (30s) as in (1). Then:

- **Problem, with scale (20s):** "Step back: about 92 million tonnes of textile waste a year, only about 1% recycled fiber-to-fiber. The bottleneck is chemistry. Carter's is the largest baby-apparel marketer in the US and Canada, over 1,000 stores, nearly 3 billion dollars in revenue, their own published figures, and even they can't close this loop, because the chemistry wasn't there."
- **Live walk (90s):** Beats 2 through 5 of (2), narrating what is real as it happens: "this ran on live recall data," "this is a real PDB," "every number traces to a pipeline output or a published paper."
- **ALWAYS close with the fixed line, regardless of branch:** "Same line item, better outcome." Then branch on the judge:
  - **Sustainability judge:** "Even safe chemistry sheds microfibers; we don't hide it, we reframe it. Our end-of-life replaces an ocean-microplastic-shedding fate with controlled industrial hydrolysis. By our rough estimate, on the order of 2 tonnes of CO2-equivalent avoided per tonne diverted, a back-of-envelope from the virgin feedstock we displace, not a full LCA."
  - **Carter's commercial judge:** "For Carter's, this is a line-item swap. You already pay to downcycle; we replace it with a fiber-to-fiber loop and a compliance asset that lowers your eco-modulated SB 707 fees, where penalty exposure runs to 50,000 dollars a day, and pre-positions you for the EU Digital Product Passport. Engine C is the year-one deployable, TRL 6 today."
  - **Cox investor judge:** "For Cox, this is the textile version of a bet you already made. You led a 150-million-dollar round to majority-own Nexus Circular, virgin-equivalent feedstock from hard-to-recycle plastic. We're that, for textiles. Spandex is 9 billion dollars today, 20 billion by 2033, and the licensing precedent exists, Hyosung Creora went bio-based to brand in about a year, LYCRA with QIRA in about three."

If it is the Cox table, go to (5).

## (4) Depth on tap, verbatim answers (one sentence, point at the proof, stop)

- **Q1, "What toxic products come off?"** "None of the bad ones. We build only on aliphatic isocyanates, so the cleavage products are aliphatic diamines, not the aromatic amines like MDA that are possible carcinogens. See this green check, aromatic amine release NONE." [point at the passport]
- **Q2, "Doesn't your enzyme need pH 10, which destroys the cotton?"** "That's the wild-type trap, and we designed around it. We engineered a Ser-His-Asp triad that works near-neutral, pH 7 to 8.5, cotton-compatible." [point at the triad label]
- **Q3, "Won't making it cleavable destroy the stretch?"** "No, because the cleavable bond lives in the soft amorphous segment, not the crystalline hard segments that carry the load. This window, 25 to 35 percent, keeps over 400 percent elongation and still degrades." [point at the curve]
- **Q4, "Can AI really design a new block copolymer?"** "On the enzyme side we took on the hard inverse-design, a de novo carbamate hydrolase with no prior art; our novelty target is no close PDB match, TM under 0.5, which we confirm when the designed structure freezes. On the fiber we never claim generative invention: it's constraint-guided screening, we enumerate, score, and filter known chemistries, the honest and defensible method. Here's the funnel." [point at the funnel]
- **Q5, "Did you actually make any of this?"** "No. It is entirely in-silico, Engine A at TRL 3, Engine B at TRL 2, with benchmark-referenced metrics. Wet-lab validation required, and we keep that badge visible. The honesty is the point." [point at the badge]
- **Q6, "What about microplastics?"** "Real concern, and we reframe rather than hide it. Any stretch garment sheds in the wash; our enzymatic end-of-life replaces the ocean-shedding fate with controlled industrial hydrolysis."
- **Q7, "Isn't this two projects?"** (non-scientist version): "The fiber and the enzyme are designed against each other. The exact chemical bond we build into the fiber is the exact bond the enzyme is built to cut. One design, not two." [point at the handoff arrow + matched-pair]
- **Q8, "Will Carter's actually pay?"** "They already do, just for the wrong outcome. They pay TerraCycle to downcycle worn onesies into pet bedding; we replace that exact line item with a fiber-to-fiber loop plus an SB 707 and EU-passport compliance asset. Same spend, better result."

## (5) The residency-ask close (Cox table only)

> "You led a 150-million-dollar round to take majority ownership of Nexus Circular, turning hard-to-recycle plastic into virgin-equivalent feedstock. REWEAR-FUSED is that exact thesis, applied to textiles. Everything you've seen is real, in-silico, and honestly labeled, which is what separates a deep-tech bet from a pitch deck. Engine C, the compliance passport, is deployable into a Carter's pilot in year one. The molecular loop validates in year two.
>
> So the ask is small and specific: ten thousand dollars and six weeks to wet-lab-validate the top matched fiber-enzyme pair, file a provisional patent, and pilot one Carter's SKU. That maps directly to what the residency wants, active progress toward IP and a minimum viable product ready for a pilot. We're the Nexus Circular of textiles, asking for the six weeks that turns the in-silico design into a filed provisional."
